### Hi! I am Wenmin, a data scientist :woman_technologist: with medical training :stethoscope: working on statistical genetics :dna:.

- I am finishing my PhD in [Quantitative Life Sciences](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/) at McGill University supervised by [Dr. Jos√©e Dupuis](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/josee-dupuis) and [Dr. Hamed Najafabadi](https://www.mcgillgenomecentre.ca/investigators/hamed-najafabadi/).
- Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in preventive medicine and data science from Fudan University.
- Currently, I am looking for my next role.

My ultimate goal is to improve healthcare for all through inclusive, reproducible and actionable research. During my PhD, I have developed several computational methods in line with this goal:

#### 1.	To identify causal genetic variants for diseases based on statistical associations and functional annotations (fine-mapping)

* We developed SparsePro to address the key challenge of integrating statistical evidence and functional genomic data.
* Software: [SparsePro](https://github.com/zhwm/SparsePro)
* Simulation and real data analyses: [Zhang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011104)
* Code to reproduce analyses: [SparsePro_analysis](https://github.com/zhwm/SparsePro_analysis)

#### 2.	To detect shared genetic signals across different phenotypes to identify actionable targets for diseases (colocalization)

*	Built upon SparsePro, we developed SharePro to account for correlation between genetic variants in colocalization analysis. 
*	Software: [SharePro_coloc](https://github.com/zhwm/SharePro_coloc)
*	Simulation and real data analyses: [Zhang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.24.550431)
*	Code to reproduce analyses: [SharePro_coloc_analysis](https://github.com/zhwm/SharePro_coloc_analysis)

#### 3.	To characterize genetic effect heterogeneity across populations with different environmental exposures (GxE)

*	We adapted SharePro to reduce multiple testing burden in GxE analysis.
*	Software: [SharePro_gxe](https://github.com/zhwm/SharePro_gxe)
*	Simulation and real data analyses: [Zhang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.27.550862)
*	Code to reproduce analyses: [SharePro_gxe_analysis](https://github.com/zhwm/SharePro_gxe_analysis)
